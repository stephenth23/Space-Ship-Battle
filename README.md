# Space-Ship-Battle

This is a game created by me, in Unity/C#. You are the commander of a spaceship. You have to fight your way through waves of enemies. There are three kinds of enemies of different specs (different health, different speed, different time of spawn). The purpose of the game is to see how many enemies can you kill before they get you. Try to beat your own score. Have fun!!
